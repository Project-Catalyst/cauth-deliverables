# Problem
Cardano doesnâ€™t have a lightweight, autonomous login mechanism.. As a result apps depend on legacy systems to authenticate users, limiting growth and decentralization

# Solution
Develop a decentralized, open-source authentication system that uses open standards and provides a way to login with just the Cardano blockchain.

## Decentralized Authentication for Cardano Applications

cAuth is an open-source authentication library that enables developers to implement "Login with Cardano" functionality using NFTs and CIP-30 compatible wallets. It provides a lightweight, decentralized alternative to traditional Web2 authentication methods without requiring complex DID infrastructure or specialized wallet implementations.

### Key Features

- Wallet-based authentication using existing Cardano wallets
- NFT-based credential management
- OAuth 2.0 bridge for Web2 application integration
- No dependency on centralized authentication providers
- Built on established Cardano standards (CIP-25, CIP-30)
- Simple integration through client libraries (JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js)

### Why CAuth?

Many dApps and Web3 applications still rely on traditional authentication methods like username/password combinations or Web2 OAuth providers (Google, Discord, etc.). While DIDs and SSI solutions are emerging, they often require complex infrastructure and specialized wallets. CAuth bridges this gap by providing a pragmatic authentication solution that leverages existing Cardano wallet infrastructure while maintaining decentralization principles.

Our approach allows developers to:

- Implement blockchain-based authentication without the complexity of full DID systems
- Remove dependencies on centralized authentication providers
- Utilize existing Cardano wallets their users already have
- Maintain compatibility with future identity solutions through NFT metadata standards.

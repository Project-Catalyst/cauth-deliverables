### Frontend Library
This is a lightweight JavaScript library for implementing "Login with Cardano" functionality in web applications. 
It handles wallet connections, NFT credential verification, and authentication flows with minimal configuration.
It can be used with the backend, if we have data that is persisted between sessions on the server, or without,
if the data can be safely stored in the front.

Key features:
- CIP-30 wallet compatibility
- NFT credential verification
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Vue components

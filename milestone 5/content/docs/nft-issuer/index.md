cAuth NFT Issuer is a web application that enables authorized parties to generate and issue authentication credentials as NFTs on the Cardano blockchain. 
Connect your CIP-30 compatible wallet, specify credential parameters, and mint authentication tokens directly to user wallets. 
These NFTs serve as blockchain-based login credentials for applications implementing the cAuth authentication system. 

A demo is launched at [dapp.cauth.org](https://dapp.cauth.org)

Code of this webapp can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/cauth-deliverables/tree/8692a135a23642e1e749567c85b37ed846521c1f/milestone%202/code)
